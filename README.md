## 🌐 Who We Are

Bāk Institute is a nonprofit research organization working to make Bengali language research free, open, and accessible to everyone. Bengali is the 7th most spoken language in the world — with 230 million native speakers — yet it remains critically underrepresented in computational linguistics and AI.

We build the tools, corpora, and models that the research community needs, and we release everything under permissive open licenses.
