On International Mother Language Day, Dr. Rahman reflects on what it means that the language the martyrs died for in 1952 still lacks a functional keyboard standard, official Unicode support for all scripts, and AI that speaks it well.

## February 21, 1952

Seventy-two years ago today, students in Dhaka were shot dead by police for demanding that Bengali be recognized as a state language of Pakistan. Their sacrifice — commemorated globally as International Mother Language Day — secured Bengali's official status and, eventually, contributed to the creation of Bangladesh.

But recognition is not the same as equity. And in the digital age, the unfinished work of language recognition has taken on a new dimension.

## The Digital Gap

Bengali is the 7th most spoken language in the world, with approximately 230 million native speakers. By any demographic measure, it should be a "large" language in the digital ecosystem.

But by digital presence, Bengali is small:

- **Web content**: Bengali represents approximately 0.3% of the indexed web, ranking roughly 35th — behind languages with a fraction of its speaker population
- **NLP resources**: Bengali has fewer annotated datasets than Dutch, a language with 25 million speakers
- **Voice assistants**: No major voice assistant (Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant) supports Bengali with the same capability as English, Spanish, or even Hindi
- **Machine translation**: Google Translate's Bengali output is noticeably worse than its Hindi or Tamil output

## It's Not Just About Technology

The digital language gap is not merely a technical problem. It is a problem of **investment**, **institutional attention**, and **political will**.

Large technology companies optimize for markets with high advertising revenue. Bengali speakers — concentrated in Bangladesh and West Bengal — represent a lower per-capita revenue opportunity than English, Japanese, or German speakers. So they get worse models, fewer engineers, and less attention.

This is a form of linguistic inequality that the 1952 language martyrs could not have imagined — but would have recognized instantly.

## What Bāk Institute Is Doing

We cannot fix the global tech industry's priorities. But we can build the infrastructure that makes Bengali-language technology possible:

1. **Open data**: Our BākoCorpus, BākoSpeech, and BengaliNER datasets are freely available — no paywall, no access request, no corporate gatekeeping
2. **Open models**: BākoLM, our Bengali language model, will be released under Apache 2.0
3. **Research**: Our 15-person team publishes at top venues (ACL, EMNLP, Interspeech) to ensure Bengali research is visible in the global academic conversation
4. **Education**: BākoLearn, our heritage learner platform, ensures the next generation maintains Bengali literacy

## A Call to Action

On this International Mother Language Day, we ask:

- **If you are a Bengali speaker in tech**: Contribute to open Bengali NLP. Even small contributions — annotating 100 sentences, reviewing a translation, filing a bug report on a Bengali-language product — add up.
- **If you are a funder**: Bengali language technology is drastically underfunded relative to speaker population. Your investment here has outsized impact.
- **If you are a policymaker**: Digital language equity should be part of language policy. The right to speak your language must extend to the right to use it online.

The martyrs of 1952 gave their lives so Bengali would be recognized. Our work — all of our work — is to ensure it is not merely recognized, but fully *functional* in the digital century.
