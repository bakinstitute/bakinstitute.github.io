Results from our landmark 12-week study with British-Bangladeshi heritage learners aged 8–16. The data is encouraging — but so are the surprises. Fahmida Islam shares what she didn't expect to find.

## The Study

Between March and June 2024, we deployed BākoLearn — our adaptive Bengali literacy platform — in 8 community schools across London, Birmingham, and Manchester. 240 heritage learners aged 8–16 used the platform for 45 minutes per week over 12 weeks.

This was not a technology demo. It was a rigorous educational study with pre-tests, post-tests, control groups, and ethical review from both Bāk Institute and our partner institution BRAC University.

## What Is BākoLearn?

BākoLearn is a tablet-based Bengali literacy application designed specifically for heritage learners — children who speak Bengali at home but are being educated in English. These learners have a unique profile: strong oral comprehension, variable reading ability, and almost no formal Bengali writing training.

The platform adapts to each learner's level and offers:
- **Script tutorials**: Learning Bengali characters through tracing and recognition games
- **Reading exercises**: Graded texts with audio support
- **Writing practice**: Guided composition with real-time feedback
- **Cultural content**: Stories, poems, and songs from Bengali literary tradition

## Results

### The Good News

After 12 weeks:
- **Reading fluency** improved by 34% on average (measured by words-per-minute on grade-appropriate text)
- **Character recognition** improved by 52% (measured by a 50-character identification test)
- **Learner engagement** was high: 87% of participants completed at least 10 of 12 sessions
- **Qualitative feedback** was overwhelmingly positive from both learners and parents

### The Surprises

**1. Sylheti-speaking children performed differently.**

About 40% of our participants spoke Sylheti (not Standard Bengali) at home. These children had significantly *higher* oral comprehension scores but *lower* reading scores than their Standard Bengali peers. BākoLearn's content is in Standard Bengali, which is linguistically quite distant from Sylheti.

This finding has major implications: heritage learner platforms cannot assume "Bengali" is one thing. We are now developing a Sylheti content track.

**2. Boys and girls had different engagement patterns.**

Girls maintained consistent engagement throughout the 12 weeks. Boys showed high initial engagement that dropped sharply in weeks 5–8 before recovering. We don't fully understand why, but we suspect it relates to the type of content — our reading passages skewed literary, and gender differences in content preference may be at play.

**3. Parents wanted to learn too.**

We received dozens of requests from parents asking if they could use BākoLearn themselves. Many parents can speak Bengali fluently but have limited literacy. This is a population we hadn't designed for — but should.

## What's Next

Based on these findings, we are:
1. Developing a **Sylheti content track** for heritage learners whose home language is Sylheti
2. Building an **adult learner mode** for parents and community members
3. Expanding to **10 additional schools** in the UK and planning a pilot in New York City
4. Publishing the full study results in a peer-reviewed education journal (submission in progress)

BākoLearn is funded by Silatech and developed in partnership with BRAC University's EdTech lab.
