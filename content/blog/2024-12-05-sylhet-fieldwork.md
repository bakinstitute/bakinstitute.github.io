Fahmida Islam and Dr. Chakraborty report from the field — recording 80 Sylheti speakers across 6 upazilas. What we learned about speaker attitudes to dialect, and the challenges of naturalistic data collection.

## Why Sylhet?

Sylheti is spoken by an estimated 11 million people in the Sylhet Division of Bangladesh, plus millions more in the UK, US, and Middle East diaspora. Despite its size, Sylheti has almost no digital presence. There is no Sylheti keyboard standard, no Sylheti Wikipedia, no Sylheti voice assistant, and — until now — no large-scale Sylheti speech corpus.

We spent 12 weeks in the field to change that.

## The Setup

Our team of four — two linguists and two recording technicians — set up temporary recording stations in six upazilas across Sylhet Division: Sylhet Sadar, Moulvibazar, Habiganj, Sunamganj, Beanibazar, and Golapganj.

### Equipment

We used a dual-microphone setup:
- **Primary**: Rode NT1-A condenser microphone in a portable vocal booth 
- **Secondary**: Zoom H6 field recorder for ambient and conversational recordings

All recordings were captured at 48kHz / 24-bit WAV. We did not use compression or noise reduction during recording — all processing happens in post-production to preserve the raw acoustic signal.

### Speaker Selection

We recruited **80 speakers** balanced across:
- Age groups: 18–30, 31–50, 51–70, 70+
- Gender: 40 male, 40 female
- Education: primary, secondary, tertiary, and no formal education
- Urban vs. rural residence

Each speaker completed three tasks:
1. **Read speech**: Reading a Sylheti text (transliterated in Bengali script)
2. **Picture description**: Describing a set of photographs in natural speech
3. **Conversation**: 20-minute unscripted conversation with another speaker from their community

## What We Learned

### Language Attitudes Are Complicated

We expected speakers to be enthusiastic about preserving their dialect. The reality was more nuanced. Many younger speakers expressed **ambivalence** about Sylheti — they use it at home but associate Standard Bengali with education and professional success.

Several older speakers, by contrast, were deeply emotional about the project. One 72-year-old woman in Sunamganj told us: *"Nobody has ever asked me to speak my own language into a machine before. I thought my words would die with me."*

### Code-Switching Is Pervasive

Almost every speaker under 40 code-switched between Sylheti and Standard Bengali within the same sentence. This is not a clean separation — it's a fluid continuum. Any NLP system that treats Sylheti and Standard Bengali as separate languages will fail on real Sylheti speech.

### Acoustic Challenges

Sylhet is *loud*. Rickshaws, construction, livestock, television, and call-to-prayer announcements create a constant ambient noise floor. Even with our portable vocal booth, achieving clean recordings required careful scheduling — we did most of our best recordings between 6 AM and 8 AM, or during the midday quietest hours.

## The Data

The 12-week fieldwork produced:
- **840 hours** of raw audio
- **520 hours** of transcribed speech (after quality filtering)
- **80 speaker metadata profiles** with sociolinguistic information
- **120 hours** of conversational speech between speaker pairs

All of this data is being integrated into the **BengaliDialects Audio** corpus and will be released under CC BY 4.0 by mid-2025.

## What's Next

We return to Sylhet in March 2025 for a second phase, focused on:
- Speakers under 18 (with parental consent)
- Speakers in the UK diaspora (London and Birmingham)
- Longitudinal recordings of the same speakers to track dialect change
