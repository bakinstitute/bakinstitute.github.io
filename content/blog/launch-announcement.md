## Welcome to Bāk Institute

We are thrilled to announce the official launch of the **Bāk Institute for Bengali Language Research**.

Bengali is the 7th most spoken language on Earth, yet it remains significantly underserved in the digital landscape. Bāk Institute exists to change that.

## Our Vision

Our vision is a world where every Bengali speaker can access and interact with technology in their native tongue as naturally as they do in English or Mandarin.

## What We Do

- **Open Data**: We release large-scale, high-quality corpora for research.
- **Open Models**: We build and share state-of-the-art language models for Bengali.
- **Open Collaboration**: We partner with institutions globally to advance language science.

Join us on this journey to make Bengali a language of open science.
