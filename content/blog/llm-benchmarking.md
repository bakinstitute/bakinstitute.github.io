## Benchmarking Bengali LLMs

As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to evolve, it is crucial to evaluate their performance on non-Western languages. Our latest research focused on benchmarking several state-of-the-art models on complex Bengali linguistic tasks.

## Key Findings

1. **Morphological Complexity**: Many models still struggle with the rich morphological system of Bengali, particularly with agglutinative verb forms.
2. **Dialect Variance**: Performance drops significantly when models are presented with regional dialects like Sylheti or Chittagonian.
3. **Contextual Nuance**: Honorifics and cultural context remain a challenge for most general-purpose models.

## Next Steps

We are developing the **BākoBenchmark v2.0**, which will focus specifically on these edge cases to push the boundaries of what's possible in Bengali AI.
