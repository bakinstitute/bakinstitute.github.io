Standard Bengali (Shuddhô Bhasha) dominates existing NLP research, leaving millions of speakers of Sylheti, Chittagonian, Rajshahi, Mymensingh, and Rangpur dialects invisible to language technology. We conduct fieldwork, build corpora, and develop computational tools for these underrepresented varieties — several of which face serious endangerment.
