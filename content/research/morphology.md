Bengali is an agglutinative language with a remarkably complex verb morphology — a single verb form can encode tense, aspect, mood, person, number, and politeness simultaneously. We develop formal computational grammars, morphological analyzers, and syntactic parsers that faithfully represent this complexity for the digital age.
