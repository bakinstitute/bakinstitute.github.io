Bengali's phonological system — with its aspirated stops, inherent vowel patterns, and sandhi rules — presents unique challenges and opportunities for speech technology. We develop ASR, TTS, and acoustic models that capture the full prosodic and tonal range of spoken Bengali across registers and dialects.
